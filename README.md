# Chinese-Literature-Dataset-

A Plain-Text Chinese Literature Dataset Built Through Python Web Scraping and Data Clearning 

This project uses BeautifulSoup to scrap public domain Chinese literature on Wikisource and use the plain text dataset for NLTK collocation analysis.

This is part of my Ph.D. dissertation research. Please see my published dissertation here: https://www.proquest.com/docview/2479780277

The chapter of my dissertation that explains the dataset and NLTK collocation analysis is in this repository.
