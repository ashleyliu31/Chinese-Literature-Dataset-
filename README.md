# Chinese-Literature-Dataset-

A Plain-Text Chinese Literature Dataset Built Through Python Web Scraping and Data Clearning 

This project uses BeautifulSoup to scrap public domain Chinese literature on Wikisource. The code downloads the plain text data and cleans the data for natural languagae processing. The process of cleaning involves removing punctuations and generating a list of all text titles.
